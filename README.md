## A website that will allow a person to guess a book title. The game will give the user one cluie at a time, for a total of 5 clues. The clues start with the most vague and get more specific as the user asks for more clues. The User gets points based on how many clues were used. If they guess on the first clue, they get 5 points, and 4 points for 2 clues, 3 points for 3 clues, 2 points for 4 clues and 1 point for 5 clues. And 0 points for an incorrect guess after all clues are given or an incorrect guess after a guess after fewer clues. The user can only guess once. 

Eventually the game will be able to expand to other forms of media. Maybe even famous people and other things along that line.
